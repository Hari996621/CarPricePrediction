Second Hand Car Price Prediction System ðŸš—ðŸ’°
The Second Hand Car Price Prediction System utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, to accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various factors. This system aims to assist both buyers and sellers in estimating fair market prices, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in the automotive market.

Key Features:
Dataset Integration: Incorporates a diverse dataset containing historical data on second hand cars, including attributes such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and more.

Feature Engineering: Engages in preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection to enhance model accuracy and performance.

Random Forest Model: Implements the Random Forest algorithm, a robust ensemble learning method that leverages multiple decision trees to predict car prices. This approach effectively captures non-linear relationships and interactions among features, resulting in reliable price estimates.

Prediction Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface where users can input car specifications, such as mileage, year of manufacture, and other relevant features, to receive an estimated market value based on the trained Random Forest model.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to ensure the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

Benefits:
Buyer Perspective: Helps potential buyers gauge the fairness of asking prices for used cars, enabling informed negotiations and ensuring value for money.

Seller Perspective: Assists sellers in setting competitive prices aligned with market trends, optimizing selling opportunities and reducing time-to-sale.

Market Insights: Provides valuable insights into pricing dynamics, trends, and factors influencing the resale value of cars in different segments of the market.
